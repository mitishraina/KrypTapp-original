# Polygon ID VC Verifier Server

This repo contains the server code you'll need to set up a VC (Verifiable Credential) gated website with Polygon ID. Complete local server setup below, then hook this verification server up to a frontend so you can limit access based on holding a VC that satisifies your requirements.

## Server functionality

- Allows [Socket.io polling](https://socket.io/docs/v3/how-it-works/) to emit session specific events back to connected clients

- Generates a [Query Based Request](https://0xpolygonid.github.io/tutorials/verifier/verification-library/request-api-guide/#query-based-request) in the form of a QR code that the user can scan to prove they own a credential that satisfies certain requirements. It also specifies the callback endpoint for verification

- Reports [Verification](https://0xpolygonid.github.io/tutorials/verifier/verification-library/verification-api-guide/) of the proof sent by the user from their Polygon ID Wallet via callback

## Local server setup

#### 1. Install server dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm i
```

#### 2. Create a .env file by copying my sample

In your .env file,

```bash
cp .env.sample .env;
```

- Update the `RPC_URL_MUMBAI` to a Polygon Mumbai RPC endpoint. I used [Alchemy's](https://alchemy.com/?r=zU2MTQwNTU5Mzc2M)
- Optionally update the `VERIFIER_DID` to your DID
- Don't change `HOSTED_SERVER_URL` or `FRONTEND_URL` yet

#### 3. Run your server on port 8080

```bash
npm start
```

#### 4. Set up ngrok server forwarding (required!)

If you don't have ngrok already set up, install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) via homebrew or download. [Login](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/login) (I used github login) to create a free account and add your account's config token to the command line.

After ngrok is set up, start a tunnel to port 8080 to expose your server to the internet beyond only being available to your laptop on localhost:8080. **This is necessary because the Polygon ID mobile wallet app will use a verfication uri you provide and needs to be able to send the verification result to this exposed public endpoint.**

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

You'll see a forwarding address in the logs

```bash
Forwarding  https://abc-your-forwarding-address-def.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8080
```

#### 5. Update the `HOSTED_SERVER_URL` field your .env file to your forwarding address

```bash
HOSTED_SERVER_URL="https://abc-your-forwarding-address-def.ngrok-free.app"
```

#### 6. Optionally customize your own proof request by changing the credentialSubject in [`proofRequest.js`](https://github.com/Sud0-AP/DID-Gated-College-Material/blob/main/server/proofRequest.js)

**default: [proofRequest](https://github.com/Sud0-AP/DID-Gated-College-Material/blob/main/server/proofRequest.js#L8)**

If you don't customize `proofRequest.js`, this server will send a verification request for an MUJCollegeID proof with Check for the boolean Enrolled to the [credentialAtomicQuerySigV2 circuit](https://docs.iden3.io/protocol/main-circuits/#credentialatomicquerysigv2). This circuit is specified by the circuitId in `vcHelpers/MUJCollegeIDCredentials.js`, set to credentialAtomicQuerySigV2.

```js

const credentialSubject = {
  enrolled: {
    $eq: true,
  },
};

```

<img width="162" alt="proof" src="https://i.imgur.com/LhXI64x.png">

The credentialAtomicQuerySigV2 circuit

- Verifies that the prover (your user) is owner of a VC with the MUJCollegeID type
- Verifies that the identity is the subject of the claim
- Verifies that the claim was signed by the issuer
- Verifies that the claim schema matches the one in the query
- Verifies that the claim is not revoked by the issuer and is not expired
- Verifies that the query posed by the verifier is satisfied by the claim. The check, `$eq: true`, written in [Query Language](https://0xpolygonid.github.io/tutorials/verifier/verification-library/zk-query-language/) verifies that the `enrolled` credentialSubject is equal to `true` or that the user is still enrolled in the college. I.E. the user "Must be a current student of Manipal University Jaipur (still can access the files)."

If all these are satisfied by the verifier, an authResponse with fields for did_doc and scope containing the valid proof will be returned via the handleVerification callback function. ðŸŽ‰

#### 7. Hook the server up to a frontend

This repo covers server setup. Next hook the server up to a frontend using this code:

- frontend github folder: https://github.com/Sud0-AP/DID-Gated-College-Material/blob/main/frontend
- additional instructions on how to get a Verifiable Credential and interact with the frontend: https://www.notion.so/oceans404/How-to-get-a-KYCAgeCredential-Verifiable-Credential-f3d34e7c98ec4147b6b2fae79066c4f6?pvs=4

# More info

## Keys folder

The keys folder holds the authV2, credentialAtomicQueryMTPV2, and credentialAtomicQuerySigV2 public verification keys necessary to verify a zero-knowledge proof. You can optionally verify these keys by following instructions [here](https://github.com/0xPolygonID/phase2ceremony)
